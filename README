Minimal implementation of an overlay network with DHT backend for video streaming simulations using OMNET++ and OverSim.

Usage:

To run Minikad you need to have installed the omnnet IDE.

After installing the IDE follow the next steps:
 1. File - Import
 2. General - Existing Projects into Workspace ( It should looks like
    this : http://cl.ly/431e885adaefab72925b )
 3. Search  minikad when you downloaded it, and select it.
 4. Once open, you can start to edit the Minikad.ned file in the
    simulations folder.
 5. An example configuration file is included, it has 3 superpeers,
    and 4 peers, in that example the peers with the property
    "flujo_brindado" are peers which have an stream and its respective
    id, the ones with "flujo_requerido" are peers which require one of
    the available streams in the network.
 6. Once you have configured your desired network, you press play and
    the simulation will start.
